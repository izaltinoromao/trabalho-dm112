## Introduction

The purpose of this work is to implement the delivery logistics service as a micro service of the complete purchase 
project. It is possible to identify, signal and verify whether or not the delivery has already been made by the system.
We also have the service of sending an e-mail to the customer after the delivery is made.

In this project, H2 was used for storage.
